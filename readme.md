# Mosu 0.2.0

## Use it. Get hired. Forget about it.

Mosu is a one-off job-hunting tool that helps you manage information about job applications.

If you're only applying to a few (1-4) positions, Mosu is not for you. 

But for the rest of ya, Mosu might help you stay organized with your various job apps.

#### For each job listing, track:
1. Company
2. Job Listing URL
3. Phase (are you just saving the listing? did you apply? are you interviewing?)
4. Salary 
5. Location 
6. Internal Contact (if you know someone at the company)
7. Internal Contact's Email
8. General Notes
9. Remote position or no?

No learning curve. Just fill out the data and it's saved.

#### Techie Stuff

 Built with ReactJS and Laravel as a back-end API.
